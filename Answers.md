1. If you saw this HTML: ```<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>``` which class has the most specificity weight?

The class with the most specificity weight is box box1 box2 box3, the specificity increases when there are more nested selectors.

2. Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;.

The difference between the two displays is that display: block takes up the whole horizontal axis causing items in this display to have its own individual lines. On other hand, display: inline; only takes up as much space as the content would allow, meaning other inline items also displayed 'inline' can appear next to it.
